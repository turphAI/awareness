## Test Commands

### Build and Verify
```bash
npm run build                    # Create production build
node scripts/verify-deployment.js  # Verify deployment readiness
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
npm run build:analyze           # Analyze bundle size
npm run lighthouse              # Run Lighthouse audit
npm run serve                   # Test production build locally
```

### Development Testing
```bash
npm start                       # Start development server
# Press Ctrl+Shift+R to toggle responsive test overlay
```

## Recommendations for Production

### Monitoring
