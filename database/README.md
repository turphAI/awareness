# PlanetScale Database Setup

This document describes the completed PlanetScale MySQL database setup for the AI Information Aggregator.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. PlanetScale Account and Database Instance
- PlanetScale account created
- Database instance `ai-awareness` created and configured
- Connection credentials configured in `.env` file

### 2. MySQL Schema Design
- Comprehensive schema designed based on existing MongoDB structure
- Schema includes all necessary tables with proper relationships
- JSON fields used for flexible data storage where appropriate
- Full schema available in `database/schema.sql`

### 3. Database Tables and Indexes
- **20 tables created** with proper indexes and relationships:
  - `users` - User accounts and profiles
  - `sources` - Information sources
  - `content` - Discovered content
  - `collections` - User content collections
  - `collection_content` - Many-to-many relationship table
  - `collection_collaborators` - Collection sharing
  - `references` - Content references and citations
  - `interactions` - User behavior tracking
  - `content_metadata` - Detailed content metadata
  - `credentials` - Encrypted authentication credentials
  - `categories` - Content categorization
  - `podcasts` - Podcast-specific data
  - `podcast_episodes` - Podcast episodes
  - `podcast_transcripts` - Episode transcripts
  - `topic_preferences` - User topic preferences
  - `content_volume_settings` - Content volume preferences
  - `discovery_settings` - Content discovery settings
  - `summary_preferences` - Summary preferences
  - `digest_scheduling` - Digest scheduling settings
  - `notification_settings` - Notification preferences
  - `interest_profiles` - User interest profiles

### 4. Connection and Testing
- Database connection utility created (`lib/database.js`)
- Connection pooling implemented for performance
- Comprehensive test suite created (`scripts/test-database.js`)
- All database operations tested and verified:
  - ✅ Basic connectivity
  - ✅ CRUD operations
  - ✅ JSON field operations
  - ✅ Foreign key relationships
  - ✅ JOIN queries

## Database Configuration

The database is configured with the following connection details:
- **Host**: `aws.connect.psdb.cloud`
- **Database**: `ai-awareness`
- **SSL**: Enabled with certificate verification
- **Connection Pooling**: Enabled (10 connections max)

## Available Scripts

- `npm run db:setup` - Initialize database tables
- `npm run db:test` - Run comprehensive database tests

## Key Features

### Security
- SSL/TLS encryption for all connections
- Encrypted credential storage
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Performance
- Connection pooling for optimal performance
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
- JSON fields for flexible schema evolution

### Scalability
- PlanetScale's automatic scaling capabilities
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Transaction support for data consistency

## Migration Ready

The database schema is designed to support migration from the existing MongoDB structure:
- All MongoDB collections mapped to MySQL tables
- JSON fields preserve complex data structures
- Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- Indexes optimize query performance

## Next Steps

The database is now ready for:
1. Data migration from MongoDB
2. API function integration
3. Frontend application connection
4. Production deployment
