}
```

### Database Integration
- ✅ Converted from MongoDB to MySQL/PlanetScale
- ✅ Uses connection pooling for efficiency
- ✅ Parameterized queries for security
- ✅ Transaction support for batch operations

### Authentication & Security
- ✅ JWT token authentication on all endpoints
- ✅ User-scoped data access (users can only access their content)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error handling with sanitized responses
- ✅ Rate limiting through batch size restrictions

### Error Handling & Resilience
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for all external API calls
- ✅ Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- ✅ Timeout handling for web scraping operations
- ✅ Malformed content handling (invalid RSS, broken HTML)
- ✅ Database connection error recovery

## API Endpoints

### Content Discovery
```
GET  /api/content/discover          # Get discovery status
POST /api/content/discover          # Trigger source discovery
```

### Content Summarization
```
GET  /api/content/summarize         # Get configuration
POST /api/content/summarize         # Summarize text or content
```

### Content Analysis
```
GET  /api/content/analyze           # Get analysis configuration
POST /api/content/analyze           # Perform batch analysis
```

## Testing Implementation

### 1. Function Structure Tests (`npm run content:test`)
- ✅ Tests API endpoint structure and authentication
- ✅ Validates request/response formats
- ✅ Confirms error handling for unauthorized access

### 2. Workflow Logic Tests (`npm run workflow:test`)
- ✅ Tests RSS parsing with sample feeds
- ✅ Tests HTML content extraction
- ✅ Tests content link detection patterns
- ✅ Tests text summarization algorithms
- ✅ Tests content categorization logic
- ✅ Tests insight extraction
- ✅ Tests academic and news content detection
- ✅ Tests error handling for invalid inputs

## Performance Optimizations

### Content Discovery
- **Link Detection**: Intelligent pattern matching to avoid processing non-content URLs
- **Batch Limits**: Maximum 10 content links per website check to prevent timeouts
- **Caching**: Content hashes to prevent duplicate processing
- **Connection Pooling**: Reused database connections for efficiency

### Summarization
- **AI Fallback**: Extractive summarization when AI is unavailable
- **Text Preprocessing**: Efficient cleaning and normalization
- **Length Optimization**: Configurable summary lengths to balance quality and speed
- **Memory Management**: Text truncation for very large content

### Analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Up to 20 items processed efficiently
- **Rule-based Fallbacks**: Fast pattern matching when AI is unavailable
- **Category Caching**: Predefined categories for quick classification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quality metrics for all analyses
