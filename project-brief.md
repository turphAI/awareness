# AI Information Aggregator - Project Brief

## Overview
An application designed to help UX Designers and professionals stay current with the rapidly evolving AI and LLM space by automatically monitoring, collecting, categorizing, and summarizing relevant information from various sources.

## Problem Statement
As a UX Designer, keeping up with the flood of news and information in the AI/LLM space is overwhelming. There's too much content across too many platforms to manually track, leading to information overload or missed important developments.

## Core Functionality

- Discover new relevant sources based on seed sources
- Extract references from podcasts like "The Daily AI Brief"
- Track academic sources (arxiv.org, dl.acn.org, sciencedirect.com, openreview.net)
- Expand source collection through recursive discovery

### Information Processing
- Categorize content by topic, relevance, and type
- Generate summaries of articles, papers, and other content
- Extract key highlights and insights
- Identify connections between different sources and topics

### User Interface
