# Design Document: AI Information Aggregator

## Overview

The AI Information Aggregator is a comprehensive system designed to help UX Designers and professionals stay current with developments in the AI/LLM space. This document outlines the technical architecture, components, interfaces, data models, error handling strategies, and testing approaches for implementing the system based on the requirements.

The system will employ a modular, scalable architecture that separates concerns between data collection, processing, storage, and presentation. It will leverage AI/ML capabilities for content analysis, summarization, and personalization while providing an intuitive user interface for information consumption and system configuration.

## Architecture

The system will follow a microservices architecture pattern with the following high-level components:

### Key Architectural Decisions:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Enables independent scaling, development, and deployment of system components.
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Services will communicate through events for asynchronous processing of content.
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralizes API management, authentication, and routing.
4. **Containerization**: Services will be containerized for consistent deployment and scaling.
5. **Cloud-Native Design**: Leverages cloud services for scalability, reliability, and managed AI capabilities.

## Error Handling

The system will implement a comprehensive error handling strategy to ensure reliability and graceful degradation:

### 1. Error Categorization

Errors will be categorized into:
- **Transient Errors**: Temporary issues that may resolve with retries (network timeouts, service unavailability)
- **Permanent Errors**: Issues that require intervention (invalid credentials, permission issues)
- **Business Logic Errors**: Issues related to application logic (invalid data, constraint violations)
- **System Errors**: Unexpected exceptions and crashes

### 2. Retry Policies

- Implement exponential backoff for transient errors
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing external services
- Dead letter queues for messages that cannot be processed

### 3. Graceful Degradation

- Provide partial functionality when some services are unavailable
- Cache critical data for offline operation
- Implement fallback mechanisms for AI/ML services

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting

- Centralized error logging
- Real-time alerting for critical errors
- Error rate monitoring and thresholds
- Correlation of errors across services

### 5. User Feedback

- Clear error messages for user-facing issues
- Actionable recovery steps where applicable
- Feedback collection for unexpected errors

## Testing Strategy
