# Vercel Deployment Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the AI Information Aggregator application to Vercel with PlanetScale database, providing the most cost-effective and developer-friendly deployment solution with automatic scaling, HTTPS, and CI/CD.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Deployment to Vercel

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the React frontend through a fast, globally distributed CDN, so that the application loads quickly from anywhere in the world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React frontend is deployed THEN it SHALL be served from Vercel's global CDN
2. WHEN users access the application THEN it SHALL load with optimized static assets
3. WHEN the frontend builds THEN it SHALL use production optimizations and code splitting
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL be accessible via HTTPS automatically

### Requirement 2: Serverless API Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend services to run as serverless functions, so that they scale automatically and only cost money when used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be handled by Vercel serverless functions
2. WHEN functions are not in use THEN they SHALL scale to zero to minimize costs
3. WHEN traffic increases THEN functions SHALL automatically scale to handle load
4. WHEN functions execute THEN they SHALL have access to environment variables and database

### Requirement 3: Database Integration with PlanetScale

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a managed MySQL database, so that data is stored reliably without server maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to PlanetScale MySQL database
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use connection pooling for efficiency
3. WHEN schema changes are needed THEN they SHALL be deployed using PlanetScale branching
4. WHEN the database scales THEN it SHALL handle increased load automatically

### Requirement 4: Custom Domain Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application via turph1023.com, so that the URL remains consistent with existing branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DNS is configured THEN turph1023.com SHALL point to the Vercel deployment
2. WHEN users visit the domain THEN they SHALL be served over HTTPS automatically
3. WHEN SSL certificates are needed THEN they SHALL be managed automatically by Vercel
4. WHEN domain propagates THEN it SHALL redirect HTTP to HTTPS automatically

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration and Secrets

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure environment variable management, so that API keys and database credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions execute THEN they SHALL have access to encrypted environment variables
2. WHEN secrets are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest and in transit
3. WHEN different environments are used THEN they SHALL have separate configurations
4. WHEN environment variables change THEN deployments SHALL use updated values

### Requirement 6: Automatic Deployment Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic deployments from GitHub, so that updates are deployed safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN it SHALL trigger automatic deployment
2. WHEN deployment starts THEN it SHALL run build processes and tests
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL be available immediately with zero downtime
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN it SHALL rollback automatically to previous version

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor application performance and usage, so that I can optimize and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL collect performance metrics automatically
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and accessible for debugging
3. WHEN functions execute THEN their performance SHALL be tracked and optimized
4. WHEN usage patterns emerge THEN they SHALL be visible in analytics dashboard

### Requirement 8: Cost Optimization and Scaling

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want predictable, usage-based pricing, so that costs scale with actual usage rather than fixed server costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is idle THEN it SHALL incur minimal or zero costs
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN costs SHALL scale proportionally with usage
3. WHEN functions are optimized THEN they SHALL use minimal execution time and memory
4. WHEN database queries are efficient THEN they SHALL minimize connection and query costs
